**Tentative project title**: Abortion access across the US

**Motivation for this project** (Maggie)

For this project, we aim to examine sociodemographic and geographical
factors that may influence access to abortion in the United States. One
study showed that of women who received a nonhospital abortion, 24%
traveled at least 50 miles from their home to an abortion facility
(Henshaw 1995). We plan to investigate the relationship between
transportation time to facility, gestational age, and race on abortion
access. We are interested in visualizing these data to hopefully help
disseminate this information in a digestible way to inform
outreach/education strategies and policy.

**Intended final products** (Rachel)

We will build a website that can be used to further public understanding
of abortion access in the United States, including visualizations of
data from the Guttmacher Instituteâ€™s 2014 Abortion Patient Survey. For
our descriptive statistics presentation, we will to focus on how
transportation time from residence location to abortion facility differs
across states and between different demographic groups. We plan to
create interactive data visualizations showing:

  - Distribution of transportation time by state (histograms or density
    ridges plots)
  - Gestational age and transportation time (scatterplot)
  - Distribution of transportation time by race (boxplot or violin plot)

In addition, we will run linear regression analyses to examine the
relationship between transportation time, race, gestational age and
other covariates on abortion access.
