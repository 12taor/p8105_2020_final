**Tentative project title**: Abortion access across the US

**Motivation for this project** (Maggie)

**Intended final products** (Rachel)

We will build a website that can be used to further public understanding
of abortion access in the United States, including visualizations of
data from the Guttmacher Instituteâ€™s 2014 Abortion Patient Survey. We
will to focus on how transportation time from residence location to
abortion facility differs across states and between different
demographic groups. We plan to create interactive data visualizations
showing:

  - Distribution of transportation time by state (histograms or density
    ridges plots)
  - Gestational age and transportation time (scatterplot)
  - Distribution of transportation time by race (boxplot or violin plot)
